            "text": "Our project will create an organic link between our cultural NGOs that are already active in the fields of music at local and regional level, in Hungary, Serbia and Italy, allowing us to expand the range of activities to a wider Trans-European level, and to actively support the international mobility of artists and cultural operators from our regions. We all share common values and a positive effort towards the preservation and enhancement of traditional music and local cultural heritage, not expressed through the replication and “musification” of the masterpieces of the folk culture of the past, but through the contemporary use of traditional instruments, techniques and repertories, that are still useful and meaningful in today’s global culture. Another common foundation is that we believe in the power of music to unite people of different age, language and culture, creating a common ground where the preservation and appreciation of diversity becomes an added value for the development of a new European identity. The TREMOLO project wants to bridge the gap between the compelling creativity in the field of living traditional music and the international music scene. It will function as an innovative liquid infrastructure that will help artists and cultural operators to travel at a European level, to exchange and share experience and opportunities, and to learn, develop and put into practice innovative strategies for transnational mobility through a developing network. We consider the creation of an Organic Link among the project partners one of the first and most important outcomes of the project. The concept of TREMOLO project is based on an extendable network of cultural and creative organizations and operators that share values and aims, and cooperate to boost the transnational mobility of music and musicians with a common approach that links traditional intangible heritage with contemporary mainstream of global culture.\n",

The guiding principle was simple: children would get invited from various countries of the continent and be hosted by families in Kecskemét. In the following year, foreign groups would invite their hosts for an exchange visit. \nOne of our main missions is to promote and spread Hungarian culture and provide publicity to Kecskemét by means of international children and youth exchanges and nourish the universal and Hungarian cultural heritage, and to collect and preserve cultural assets, to ensure a cultural location for the purpose of implementing the above\nOur programmes serve as the means to deepen knowledge about Hungarians living beyond the current borders of our country and foster cultural exchange relations. \nThrough our publications and events we intend to support the ideals and accomplish the aims set out upon the establishment of the Association, that is, to foster the future citizens of Europe, today’s children to become a tolerant generation free from all prejudices.\nBearing these objectives of high priority in mind, The Future of Europe International Children & Youth Festival is organized every second year, alternated with international cultural youth exchanges regularly.\n",

                "description": "Founded in 2015 by Gábor Kovács (Tindia) and Boldizsár Tamás, the duo started out as a cautious attempt at placing traditional instruments in a unique context, drawing respectably from an authentic folklore repertoire. Later accompanied by Róbert Schneider (Speakers of Zion) and Zsolt Moldván (Ethnofil, now Odd ID), folk tunes slowly took the back seat as our style evolved to what it is now: designer folk. \nOur sound is unquestionably rooted in Hungarian folklore, thanks to the extensive use of instruments like the zither, or the shepherd’s flute, but our music evolved pretty far beyond that. Building firmly on the combination of stirring basslines and the evocative rhythms of the cajon, we have turned more to creating original instrumental pop pieces, incorporating various different stylistic elements from multiple genres, including rock, funky, and even EDM.\nLast year, we became the discovery of the year in the national musical talent development programme Öröm a zene, and this year, we are participating in a nation-wide mentorship programme —Hangfoglaló Program— organized by the National Cultural Fund of Hungary.\n\n**MEMBERS**\n- Boldizsár Tamás - hungarian zither \n- Gábor Kovács - hungarian shepherd’s flute, jaw harp \n- Róbert Schneider - bass guitar \n- Zsolt Moldván - cajon\n",

With our Piccola Orchestra we like to compose and perform original songs to tell simple stories, but with relevant underlying social themes. Striving to connect Local and Global in a culturally-polyhedric world that still manages to be “One”.\n",

Even a chunk of our lyrical concept deals with the idea of home and this very special place, which is truly a multi-cultural area. Our voice speaks from the heart of a minority, as we are trying to preach love and acceptance.\nTherefore, our ambition is to create a community of like-minded friends and fans in Vojvodina as well as in the whole Balkan peninsula and other parts of Europe. For now, the band has played multiple shows in Serbia and Hungary but has never been any further than their borders. We believe, if we could learn more about the music industry through collaborations and we could gain some new experiences outside our comfort zone, we could reach our full potential as a band. After all, we are trying to put our band on the map of world music and rock'n'roll.\n",
